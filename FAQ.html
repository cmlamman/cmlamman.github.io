									<h2 id="artwork">Can I use your artwork / figures?</h2>
									<p>Yes, as long as it isn't for commercial use and you include the proper credits. Everything on this website is copywrite 2025 Claire Lamman, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC BY-NC 4.0 (click for specific terms)</a>. 
										If you're unsure, feel free to email me. I also just like to get messages when someone finds my work useful :) <br>
									
									<h2 id="annotations">How do you make the paper annotations?</h2>
									<p><a href="paper_doodles.html">See this page for a PowerPoint template, tips on creating annotations, and to see what others have made!</a><br>

									<h2 id="astronomer">How do I become an astronomer?</h2>
									<p> <b>General advice:</b> Learn how to code, especially Python. Take math classes seriously but don't be discouraged if they don't seem to come naturally to you! 
										You don't need to be a math wizard to be a great scientist, but you do need the ability to perservere through problems that are difficult for you. 
										Avoid AI when learning. Be creative and curious.</p>

										<b>Education:</b> For applying to colleges, look for schools that have strong physics or astronomy undergraduate programs, with faculty that are active in research. 
										There are astronomy jobs available to people with a bachelor's degree, but most professional astronomers have a PhD. 
										This means you need to go to graduate school after (typially 4 years of) college.
										To get into a PhD program, you need research experiences. Reach out to faculty in your department about getting involved in their group 
										by your second year of undergrad, and look for <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/reu-research-experiences-undergraduates">opportunities to do summer research</a>. </p>

									<h2 id="books">What astronomy books do you recommend?</h2>
									Here are just a few of the many great books out there:
									<ul>
										<li><b>For general public:</b> A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, The End of Everything by Katie Mack</li>
										<li><b>Introductory undergrad text book:</b> The Cosmic Perspective by Jeffrey Bennett+</li>
										<li><b>Advanced undergrad text book:</b> Astrophysics in a Nutshell by Dan Maoz</li>
										<li><b>Grad-level:</b> What else but the Big Orange Bible?? An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics by Carroll and Ostlie</li>
									</ul>

									<h2 id="mentor">Will you be my research mentor?</h2>
									<p>I am not currently looking for remote students. If we are in the same collaboration or institution, come talk to me!<br>

									<h2 id="theory">Will you read my theory about the Universe?</h2>
									<p>No, sorry. I think Katie puts it best: <a href="https://www.astrokatie.com/faq#theory">Katie Mack FAQ</a>.</p>
